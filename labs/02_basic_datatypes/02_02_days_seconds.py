'''

Write a script that takes in a number in days from the user between 1 and 1,000,000,000 and convert it to seconds.

NOTE: We will use the input() funtion to collect users input. An example is demonstrated below.

'''

# the input of the user will be saved in the variable days. (sentence)
# because the input() function collects the input as a string, we have to convert it to an int
# The string passed to the input() function is what the user is prompted with
days = int(input("Please enter a number in days between 1 and 1,000,000,000: "))

sentence = input("Pick a random number of days from 1 to 1,0000,0000")
